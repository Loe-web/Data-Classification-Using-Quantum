## Data Classiication using Quantum

As quantum supremacy has been reached, we can take advantage of the benefits that lie with using quantum computers to solve problems. Despite quantum machine learning being in its early stages, there are advantages that lie with using it. The uniqueness of Quantum Machine Learning comes from the fact that input features are into higher dimensional features vector space using the available feature maps (Zfeature map, Zfeature map, etc) due to this, data is encoded into a Quantum state.

We will look at two datasets in the medical field(from kaggle.com)and classify the data using Quantum Support Vector Machine.
